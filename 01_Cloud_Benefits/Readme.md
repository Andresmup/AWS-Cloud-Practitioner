# THE BENEFITS OF THE CLOUD

The benefits of the cloud is a summary of reasons why an organization would consider adopting or migrating to utilizing public cloud.

 - Agility: Increase speed and agility
 - Pay as you go: Trade capital expense for variable expense
 - Economy of scale: Benefit from massive economies of scale
 - Global reach: Go global in minutes
 - Security

In Cloud Arquitecture
 - Reliability: Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
 - High Availability
 - Scalability: Benefit from massive economies of scale
 - Elasticity
 - Fault tolerance
 - Disasters recovery


The benefits of the cloud is a reworking and expansion of the Six Advantages of Cloud

## SIX BENEFITS OF THE CLOUD (by AWS)

 1. *Trade capital expense for variable expense:* You can **Pay On Demand** meaning there is no upfront cost and you pay only for what you consume or pay by the hour, minutes or seconds. Insted of paying for upfront costs of data centers and servers.
 2. *Benefits of masive economies of scale:* You are **sharing the cost with others customers** to get unbeatable savings. Hundreds of thousands of customers utilizing a fraction of a server.
 3. *Stop guessing capacity:* **Scale up or down** to meet current need. Lauch and destroy services whenever. Instead of payings for idle or underutilized servers.
 4. *Increase speed and agility:* **Launch resources withing few clicks in minutes**. Insted of waiting days or weeks of your IT to implement the solution on-premise.
 5. *Stop spending money on running and maintaning data centers:* **Focus on your own customers**, developing and configuring yours applications. Instead of operations such as of racking, stacking, and powering centers.
 6. *Go global in minutes:* **Deploy your app in multiple regions around the world with few clicks**. Provide lower latency and better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

## SEVEN ADVANTAGES OF THE CLOUD

 1. *Cost-effective:* You **pay for what you consume**, no up-front cost. On-demand pricing or Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) with thousands of customers sharing the cost of the resources.
 2. *Global:* Lauch workloads **anywhere in the world**, just by choosing the region.
 3. *Secure:* Cloud provider takes cares of physical security. Cloud service can be secure by default or you have the ability to configure access down granular level.
 4. *Reliable:* Data backup, disaster recovery, data replication and fault tolerance.
 5. *Scalable:* Increase or decrease resources and services based on demand.
 6. *Elastic:* **Automate** scaling during spikes and drop in demand.
 7. *Current:* The underlying hardware and managed software is patched, upgraded and replaced by cloud provider without interruption to you.
