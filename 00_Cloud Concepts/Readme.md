# CLOUD CONCEPTS

## WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING?

Cloud computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

On premise you have the responsability to:
 - Own the servers
 - Hire the IT people
 - Pay or rent the real-state
 - Take all the risk

On Cloud Providers, the provider is resposable for:
 - Own the servers
 - Hire the IT people
 - Pay or rent the real-state
 - You only are responsable for configuring the cloud services and code
